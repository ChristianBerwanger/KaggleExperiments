# Machine Learning Experiments
This project serves as a practical investigation into fundamental machine learning concepts, demonstrated through a series of experiments on diverse datasets. It is purely for me to deepen my understanding of some concepts and techniques. 

## Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset](./Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_Diagnostic_Dataset/) investigates some binary classication models. XG Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and a simple Multi Layer Perceptron are implementent. Parameters are optimized with a grid search and the final models are compared.
